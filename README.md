Explore NASA expoplanet archive; correlations between solar system planets and suns

Possible Objectives:

1. Use a fisher's test to find the correlation between the number of stars and the number of planets in a solar system
2. Complete a colineaity test between the mass and the temperature of the planet, and check if it adheres to theoretical ideals
3. Discover how the size and distance of planets discovered planets changed over time. User a best-fit model to predict the average size and distance in 2030


Selection:

Complete a colinearity test between the mass of planets and the temperature of planets, and check if it adheres to theoretical ideals. 


Goals: 
1. Research theoretical models of covarience between the mass and temperature of a planet, select one
2. Compare the colinearity test to the theoretical model, create a plot showing both the actual data and the theoretical model
3. Discuss implications of the results, does the data support or contradict the theoretical model; 
   what are the boundaries of the errors?
   
   
Introduction:

The ideal gas law is well know in physics: PV = nRT. Pressure and temperature are directly proportional in an ideal gas. Though planets with mixed state contents would not be expected to follow the ideal gas law, it is true the the interior of planets tend to be hotter than the surface of the planet. My expectation is that the interior temperature of a planet tends to be proportional to the mass of a planet, via observation of all discovered planets. The NASA exoplanet archives has the blackbody temperature of all disovered exoplanets. I will conduct a covarience test to see if planet mass and blackbody temperature of planets are directly proportional.
