Explore NASA expoplanet archive; correlations between solar system planets and suns

Possible Objectives:

1. Use a fisher's test to find the correlation between the number of stars and the number of planets in a solar system
2. Complete a colineaity test between the mass and the temperature of the planet, and check if it adheres to theoretical ideals
3. Discover how the size and distance of planets discovered planets changed over time. User a best-fit model to predict the average size and distance in 2030


Selection:

Complete a colinearity test between the mass of planets and the temperature of planets, and check if it adheres to theoretical ideals. 


Goals: 
1. Research theoretical models of covarience between the mass and temperature of a planet, select one
2. Compare the colinearity test to the theoretical model, create a plot showing both the actual data and the theoretical model
3. Discuss implications of the results, does the data support or contradict the theoretical model; 
   what are the boundaries of the errors?
